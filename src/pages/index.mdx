hello!

i write code ~~and sometimes break stuff~~

i'm currently a computer engineering student (focused on software engineering),
while working part-time (also in software development :))

## random tech stack stuff i work with

- langs: typescript, kotlin, c#
- frameworks: react, vue, tailwindcss, asp.net core
- technologies: git, docker, linux, windows, macOS
- tools: vscode, intellij-based IDEs

## about me

i love listening to music all day (hence why the "now playing/last listened to"
thingy on the sidebar, or at the bottom on mobile). two of my favorite music
genres are alternative and vocaloid.

i also love playing rhythm games, such as project diva and sometimes osu!.

i don't tend to watch a lot of anime but i do enjoy watching some from time to
time. some of my favorite ones are
[brand new animal](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40060/BNA) and
[yuru camp](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34798/Yuru_Campâ–³)
